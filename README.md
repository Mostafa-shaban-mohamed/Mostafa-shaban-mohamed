## 🚀 About Me
🎓 My Name is **_Mostafa Shaaban Mohamed_**, a self-motivated **.NET full-stack developer** with experience working on multiple projects, outstanding preformer in **C# (ASP.NET) & React & Angular**, graduated from P.H.I.

👨‍💻 I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2021, I learned **React.JS**, **Single Page Application** and **Responsive web apps**. I got started with Blogging quite recently and still work in progress. In Late 2022, I started learning Angular and still work in progress too. Now I can design, build and develop a full web application, front-end using either React Or Angular, back-end using ASP.NET Core (Clean-Archiecture, MVC Design, Three-layers Design) and Database using MS SQL Server (2014-2022).
